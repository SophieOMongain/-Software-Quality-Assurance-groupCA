## Areas for Improvement

- **Task Breakdown:**  
  Spend additional time during planning to break tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. This approach helps reduce ambiguity, improve estimation accuracy, and ensure that every aspect of a task is well understood.

- **Enhance Communication:**  
  Increase the frequency of check-ins and daily stand-ups. By doing so, the team stays aligned, blockers are identified early, and everyone remains aware of project progress and challenges.

- **Improve Code Review Efficiency:**  
  Develop and implement a standardized code review checklist. This checklist will streamline the review process, ensure consistent feedback across the team, and reduce the chance of overlooking critical issues.

- **Time Management Improvements:**  
  Use timeboxing for meetings and individual tasks. This practice helps prevent overcommitment, keeps discussions focused, and ensures steady progress throughout the development cycle.
