# Task Estimation

## Introduction
Task estimation is a critical practice in agile development and Scrum that helps teams forecast the effort, time, and resources required to complete tasks or user stories. It enables us to plan sprints effectively, balance workloads, and continuously improve our processes. At our company, we use task estimation to ensure realistic sprint commitments, manage risks, and drive continuous improvement throughout our development cycle.

## Best Practices (Do’s)

### For Estimators:
- **Collaborate:** Involve all team members in estimation sessions (e.g., using Planning Poker) to capture diverse perspectives.
- **Break Down Tasks:** Decompose large user stories into smaller, manageable tasks for more accurate estimates.
- **Use Relative Estimation:** Apply story points or T-shirt sizing to focus on relative effort and complexity rather than precise time estimates.
- **Iterate and Refine:** Regularly revisit and adjust estimates as more information becomes available.
- **Document Assumptions:** Clearly record any assumptions or uncertainties that might affect the estimates.

### For Scrum Masters / Facilitators:
- **Timebox Sessions:** Keep estimation meetings focused and efficient by setting clear time limits.
- **Encourage Open Discussion:** Foster a collaborative environment where team members can openly discuss and challenge estimates.
- **Leverage Historical Data:** Use past sprint performance and velocity to inform current estimations.
- **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously track team velocity and adjust future estimates to better reflect real-world performance.

## Bad Practices (Don'ts)
- **Over-Precision:** Avoid assigning overly precise, time-based estimates early in the project.
- **Exclusion:** Do not rely solely on one person’s perspective; exclude no team member from the process.
- **Ignoring Uncertainty:** Failing to factor in risks, unknowns, or potential scope changes can lead to underestimation.
- **Rigid Estimates:** Resist the temptation to stick with initial estimates when project requirements or team capacity change.
- **Skipping Discussion:** Do not rush through estimation sessions; thorough discussion is essential for clarity and consensus.
