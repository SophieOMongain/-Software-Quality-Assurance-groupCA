# **Task Estimation in Scrum**

This section of the **Software Quality Handbook** outlines best practices for estimating tasks and user stories within a Scrum framework. It emphasizes **agile team roles**, **effective communication**, **realistic sprint planning**, and **good vs. bad practices**. By following these guidelines, teams can improve their planning accuracy and continuously refine their development process.

## **What's Included**
- **Roles in Agile Teams**
  - **Developers/Team Members**
    - Participate actively in estimation sessions (e.g., Planning Poker)
    - Break down large user stories into manageable tasks
    - Provide feedback and share insights on task complexity
  - **Scrum Masters**
    - Facilitate and timebox estimation meetings
    - Remove blockers and clarify uncertainties during discussions
    - Share historical sprint data to guide current estimates
  - **Product Owners**
    - Clarify user stories and define acceptance criteria
    - Prioritize tasks based on business value and urgency
    - Communicate expectations and deliverables to the team
- **Communication Patterns**
  - **Open Dialogue**
    - Encourage contributions from every team member
    - Use techniques (e.g., Planning Poker) to foster consensus
  - **Structured Meetings**
    - Set clear agendas for estimation sessions
    - Timebox discussions to keep them efficient and focused
  - **Documentation & Transparency**
    - Record assumptions, uncertainties, and decisions
    - Maintain accessible records of estimates and revisions
- **Sprint Planning**
  - Utilize refined estimates to select sprint backlog items
  - Balance team capacity with task complexity
  - Adjust sprint plans based on historical velocity and feedback
- **Good Practices & Bad Practices**
  - **Good Practices:** Collaborative estimation, task breakdown, iterative refinement
  - **Bad Practices:** Over-precision, excluding key team members, rushing through sessions

## **Who It's For**
- **Scrum Teams & Agile Practitioners:** Those using Scrum or agile methodologies.
- **Developers & Project Managers:** Individuals involved in sprint planning and task allocation.
- **Improvement Seekers:** Teams aiming to enhance their estimation techniques and project delivery.

### **Roles in Agile Teams**
- **Developers / Team Members**
  - Participate actively in estimation sessions (e.g., Planning Poker)
  - Break down large user stories into manageable tasks
  - Provide feedback and share insights on task complexity

- **Scrum Masters**
  - Facilitate and timebox estimation meetings
  - Remove blockers and clarify uncertainties during discussions
  - Share historical sprint data to guide current estimates

- **Product Owners**
  - Clarify user stories and define acceptance criteria
  - Prioritize tasks based on business value and urgency
  - Communicate expectations and deliverables to the team

### **Communication Patterns**
- **Open Dialogue**
  - Encourage contributions from every team member
  - Use techniques (e.g., Planning Poker) to foster consensus
- **Structured Meetings**
  - Set clear agendas for estimation sessions
  - Timebox discussions to keep them efficient and focused
- **Documentation & Transparency**
  - Record assumptions, uncertainties, and decisions
  - Maintain accessible records of estimates and revisions

### **Sprint Planning**
- **Refined Estimates to Select Sprint Backlog Items**  
  Use the estimates generated during backlog refinement to determine which user stories or tasks the team can realistically complete in the upcoming sprint.
- **Balance Team Capacity with Task Complexity**  
  Ensure that the total estimated effort does not exceed the team’s velocity or capacity for that sprint.
- **Historical Velocity & Feedback**  
  Adjust sprint plans based on the team’s past velocity and any feedback from previous retrospectives.

### **Good Practices & Bad Practices**

- **Good Practices**  
  - **Collaborative Estimation**: Involve the entire team (Dev Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner) in estimation sessions.  
  - **Task Breakdown**: Split large user stories into smaller, more manageable tasks for clearer estimates.  
  - **Iterative Refinement**: Update estimates as new information emerges or uncertainties are resolved.  

- **Bad Practices**  
  - **Over-Precision**: Trying to predict exact hours or lines of code, leading to false confidence.  
  - **Excluding Key Team Members**: Leaving out stakeholders (e.g., testers, designers) can result in incomplete estimates.  
  - **Rushing Through Sessions**: Not discussing potential risks or complexities thoroughly, leading to unrealistic estimates.
