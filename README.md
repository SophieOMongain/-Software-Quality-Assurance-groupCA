#  Software Quality Handbook

Welcome to the Software Quality Handbook for our engineering team! This guide outlines the best practices we follow to ensure that the software we build is reliable, secure, and maintainable.

##  Purpose

As a small and fast-moving startup, we’ve often experienced inconsistent development practices, unpredictable project progress, and bugs making their way into production. This handbook aims to fix that.

It serves as a shared reference for **how we do things the right way** — from task planning to writing secure, production-ready code. It’s designed for both new members and existing team members to stay aligned.

##  What’s Inside

This handbook covers three essential areas of software quality:

1. **Task Estimation in Scrum**
   - Common pitfalls and strategies to improve planning accuracy and predictability.

2. **Code Reviews**
   - How to conduct effective, respectful, and helpful code reviews that improve quality and collaboration.

3. **Security and Secure Coding Practices**
   - How to build secure software from day one, avoid common vulnerabilities, and embed security into our development lifecycle.

Each section includes:
- A short introduction to the topic
- Easy-to-read do’s and don’ts
- Diagrams where helpful
- Links to real-world articles and personal blog posts from experienced developers

##  How to Use This Handbook

- **New team members**: Start here. This is how we work.
- **Current team members**: Use this as a reference to guide your day-to-day work and decisions.
- **Everyone**: Keep improving it. If you learn something valuable, consider submitting a pull request.

##  Project Structure

This handbook was developed collaboratively using **trunk-based development**:
- Each topic was researched and written in a feature branch
- All content was reviewed via pull requests before merging to `main`
- Markdown was used to keep the content clean, lightweight, and version-controlled

You’ll also find:
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` – how we planned and organized the work
- `RETROSPECTIVE.md` – what we learned from doing this together
- `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` – who contributed what
