# Project Plan: Software Quality Assurance Handbook

**Course/Module**: Software Quality Assurance 
**Assignment**: Software Quality Assurance Assignment (30% of Overall Grade)  
**Due Date**: 30th March 2025

## 1. Overview

We are creating a **Software Quality Assurance Handbook** to help a startup team of 20 software engineers adopt best practices. This handbook will include:
- **Team Structure** best practices  
- **Code Reviews** best practices  
- **Secure Coding Practices** best practices

The final deliverable will be a **Markdown-based handbook** stored in our **public GitHub repository**, containing:
1. An introduction and context  
2. The 3 main topics (each ~500–1000 words), including **good and bad practices**  
3. Diagrams/visual aids   
4. A **Team Work Table** summarizing our contributions  
5. A short reflection on what we would do differently next time

## 2. Team Members & Roles

**Our 3 team members** 

| **Name**        | **Role**                                    |-----------------|----------------------------------------------
| Adam | - Contributor & Editor          
| Sophie  | - Contributor & Editor                       
| Whitney | - Contributor & Editor                      

**High-Level Responsibilities**:
- **Sophie**: 
  - Set up GitHub repository.  
  - Co-author topics: **Task Estimation** and **Secure Practices**  
- **Adam**:
  - Create branch for project plan
- Co-author topics: **Code Reviews** and **Secure Practices**   
- **Whitney**:
  - Co-author **Task Estimation** and **Testing Practices**

## 3. Topics & Assignments

We will produce three main sections in our handbook, each assigned to two members:

1. **Task Estimation**  
   - Owners: Sophie and Whitney  
   - Focus: Whitney (Roles in agile teams, communication patterns), Sophie (sprint planning, good/bad practices)

2. **Code Reviews**  
   - Owners: Adam and Whitney
   - Focus: Adam (Why code reviews matter, best practices (checklists, small diffs etc.)), Whitney (common pitfalls, example workflows)

3. **Secure Practices** 
   - Owners: Adam and Sophie 
   - Focus: Adam (How to build secure software from day one, avoiding common vulnerabilities), Sophie (embed security into development lifecycle)

---

## 4. GitHub Workflow

1. **Repository Setup**  
   - Sophie creates a **public GitHub repository**, initializes with a `README.md`.

2. **Branching Strategy**  
   - Each topic gets its own feature branch 
   - Team members commit their drafts to these feature branches.

3. **Issues & Pull Requests**  
   - Create GitHub **Issues** for each main task (writing a topic, creating diagrams, reviewing).
   - When a topic draft is ready, open a **Pull Request** (PR) to `main`.  
   - Tag the other team members for **code review** on the PR.

4. **Code Reviews**  
   - Each member reviews at least one topic that they did not primarily write.  
   - Provide feedback via PR comments  
   - Authors revise the draft accordingly and push changes to the same branch.

5. **Merging & Finalization**  
   - Once all feedback is addressed, the PR is approved and merged into `main`.  
   - By the final due date, all sections (including introduction, conclusion, references, and Team Work Table) must be merged.

## 6. Handbook Content Structure

Our final handbook will include:

1. **Introduction**  
   - Context: Startup with 20 engineers, unpredictable progress, high defect rate.  
   - Purpose: Provide concise, easy-to-skim best practices.  

2. **Team Structure** (Sophie and Whitney)  
   - Explanation of roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Dev Team)  
   - Good vs. bad practices for cross-functional teams  
   - Diagrams or visuals  

3. **Code Reviews** (Adam and Whitney)  
   - Purpose and benefits  
   - Best practices (small diffs, constructive feedback, automated checks)  
   - Common pitfalls (rushed reviews, no follow-up)  
   - Sample workflow in GitHub  

4. **Secure Practices** (Adam and Sophie)  
   - Explanation of why it’s crucial (ensure security in development cycle, building secure software)  
   - Good vs. bad practices  
   - Practical examples and references  

5. **Conclusion**  
   - Key takeaways, final thoughts  

6. **Team Work Table**  
   - Summarize who contributed what  

7. **Reflection**  
   - “What we would do differently next time”
